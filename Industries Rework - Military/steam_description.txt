This mod attempts to improve the military industries situation by reworking or adding production methods to represent the mobilisation and demobilisation of industries during war time.
It contains the [i]excellent[/i] [b][url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2990348796]Automotive Industry Rework[/url][/b] by indexo4, included with permission.

[h1]Features:[/h1]
To better represent the ability of a country with large civilian industry to "mobilize" its factories to a wartime economy:
[h2]Automotive Industry Rework:[/h2]
[list]
[*]The "Motor Industries" building from vanilla only produces engines now, and has been renamed to "Steam Engine Industries"
[*]The "War Machine Industries" have been replaced with "Automotive Industries", which produces Automobiles and has secondary PM's for Tanks and Aeroplanes.
[*]Besides those changes, the costs involved with making automobiles have been rebalanced, to bring them more in line with other heavy industries.
[/list]

[h2]Tooling from Small Arms and Artillery:[/h2]
[list]
[*]New PM line allowing you to convert 50%, 30%, 10%, or 0% of your military goods production into tools. - Default is 50% tool production.
[*]Different levels are available depending on the Base PM in use - which means there are [i]many[/i] options; as such options that you cannot use are hidden. When changing the Base PM, be aware you'll need to update the Demobilisation PM as well.
[*]- It was more efficient to use the existing military industries and represent them as less-specialised industries capable of mobilisation, rather than put mobilisation PM's onto the tool industry which would cause dramatic swings in economy whenever the PM was changed.
[/list]

[h2]Explosives from Munitions:[/h2]
[list]
[*]As above: New PM line allowing you to convert 50%, 30%, 10%, or 0% of your military goods production into explosives. - Default is 50% tool production.
[*]Often you won't actually get explosives out of these, they'll just subsidise their consumption of explosives with some level of self-sufficiency.
[/list]

[h2]More Radio PM's:[/h2]
Radio production now has 3 levels along a similar concept to the others.

This and the original Automotive Rework mod will be managed by load order - in case their content ever diverges.

Otherwise this only touches motor, electrics, and military industries. It should otherwise not bother anything else.
